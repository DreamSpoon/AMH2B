# Eyelid

## Add Lid Look
Use the settings given (e.g. eye bone names, rotation limits) to automatically add bone constraints to eyelids so that eyelids will move as eyes rotate up/down.

The MHX rig has a "gaze" bone, which lets the user easily adjust eye rotations to "look at" a point in space. "Copy Rotation" bone constraints are added to eyelid bones to copy some of the rotation from the eye bones, so eyelid movement matches eye movement.
